# PremierLeagueApp

This application is called – Premier league database. It means that in csv file it is all football players who is playing in top division in England. Purpose for my application is to manage the data in csv, create and add new players and save it back to csv file, sort all data by few criteria’s and find specific player. The main purpose and biggest struggle was to work out with a lot of data in csv, format it in clean table and print that table looks nice and clean for the user.
With this application user will be able to get more information about top division players in England. They can play around and see which players playing in specific team, find out about their age, position, nationality and price value in the market. If user want to find out about specific player he need to just go to menu option “FIND the player”, input the player’s name and after that program will find that player and print more information about him in nice and clean table. It is another menu option which user can use: “Sort the player”. This feature is able to sort the players by nationality, age and position. If user want to sort the player by one of the mentioned criteria’s he just need to input the search term word and program will print all players sorted by chosen criteria.
